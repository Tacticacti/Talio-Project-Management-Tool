### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Students uploaded a single pdf file.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The recommended structure includes a list of stakeholders,
important terms of the domain, a list of user stories, and mockups that illustrate the application.


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: The example of a backlog that you got from last year is outdated.
Instead of structuring your backlog by Musts, Shoulds, Coulds,
you were asked during the lecture to model every feature individually as an  _epic_ .
Your list of epics should be complete and its prioritization should be consistent with lecture.
You should also contain an epic for a "minimal app".
Your epics should have an introduction that clarifies the features and use mock-ups to complete descriptions.
The assignment got updated on Thursday, so there is some new stuff there that you probably haven't noticed before.

(Note that this is only a draft, so this mark will not have an impact on your final grade)


### User Stories

Mark: Good/Very Good

Feedback: The user stories follow the required format and have a clear focus on the user perspective. 
Your user stories have a clear focus and do not overlap. All epics should be covered with good amount of user stories
(which is hard to judge in your case since you structured your backlog differently). 



### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Good/Very Good

Feedback: The size of most user stories is small and their effect is clear, so the acceptance criteria are implicit. 
A few of your stories are a bit ambiguous. Note that user stories / acceptance criteria should be 
formulated in a measurable and observable way such that it is easy to decide when a story is finished.
