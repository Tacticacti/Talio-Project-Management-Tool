# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Edward Oh Jang Hun

Minute taker: Wiktor Ciupa≈Ç

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker. 


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository on time. It followed the template. 
And the points were clear so that everyone could prepare. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: ----------

Feedback: The template changed from last week. 
The performance of the previous minute taker can be seen in the feedback from last week.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good/ Very good

Feedback: The chair did ensure that all topics of the agenda were covered in the appropriate amount of time. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: Everyone *tried* to ask some questions,
comment something, be involved in the discussion. But this could be further improved on in the future.
You could try asking each other directly for an opinion on something.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient/Good

Feedback: They started with giving an overview for tasks for this week. 
There were planing the GUI of the application. They divided some tasks for this week. 
They had a discussion presenting how far they are for tasks for this week
(They discussed the gitlab assignment).
There is progress visible compared to last week. They seem to be on track right now :)
I was hoping to see a discussion about a division of coding tasks for this week,
since you are planning to start coding soon.

After you start coding we expect you to:

Present a current state of their *potentially shippable* application. 
Present to me all changes that were merged to main.
(You could have it as one of the agenda points).
