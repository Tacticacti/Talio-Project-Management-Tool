# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

#### Focused Commits

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: Due to non-existence of data. 
You haven't committed any java code to main before the git inspector was run.
This rubric point is about individual commits representing a coherent change to the system.
Tips:
- Commits should affect a small number of files
- Commit message should be concise and clearly summarise the changes the commit is making

#### Isolation

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: Due to non-existence of data.
Here we will assess how you use feature branches/merge requests to isolate individual features during development.

Tips:
- Never commit directly to main
- MRs should not be convoluted or have a large scope

#### Reviewability

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: Due to non-existence of data.
Here we will assess how easy it is to review the average MRs of the group.

Tips:
- MRs should contain small number of commits where each change is related to each other
- Mark some MRs as drafts
- MRs should have clear descriptions and a title

#### Code Reviews

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: Due to non-existence of data.
Here we will assess how well you use MRs to review each other's source code contribution and provide feedback.
We are looking to see back and forth discussions that actually lead to improvements

Tips:
- MRs should not stay open for a long time


#### Build Server

Grade: Insufficient

Feedback: Due to non-existence of data. 
Here we assess whether the build Server was an important part of the development process.

Tips:
- Builds should not fail frequently
- It should be your top priority to fix a build after it fails
- Add checkstyle rules
- Commit and push frequently
