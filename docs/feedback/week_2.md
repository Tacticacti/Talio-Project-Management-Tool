## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**:  Jaoud
- **Notetaker**: Bobi


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There were a chair and a minute taker during the meeting. 


#### Agenda

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: You don't need to have a specific start time. 
You can just add approximations of how many minutes each point will take.

#### Chair performance


Mark:  (very) Good / Excellent

Feedback: The chair took initiative throughout the meeting,
covered all the agenda points, and encouraged others to speak up and discuss different topics. 
He did and amazing job, but to further improve he could encourage others to speak up even more!

#### Time management

Mark: (nearly) Excellent

Feedback: You kept track of time.  
Always nice to have some time left towards the end of meeting so that if I have some remarks we won't go over time. 

#### Minute taker performance

TA Instructions: Is there a good amount of notes? Do the notes contain the team agreements and the assigned people?

Mark: (very) Good / Excellent

Feedback: There is an excellent amount of notes. 
Notes contain all team agreements and task distribution with assigned people. 
In the future, you don't need to follow the agenda template so carefully when making notes. 
Since for some agenda points you don't have minutes, more text just makes it seem less readable. 

#### Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: You had a lot of nice discussions together, 
but I would like to see even more group discussions where everyone contributes _equally_.
